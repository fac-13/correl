## Gitflow

 - assign yourself to an issue and add `in-progress` label :traffic_light: 
 - starts work on issue
 - commit work referencing issue add maybe adds an [emoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) :smile: 
 - create a pull request
     - reference issue
     - add description of work completed
     - `assign` all of your team
     - if you are still working on the PR add [WIP] to the title (work in progress)
- __everybody__ in the team reviews the PR - **IMPORTANT!!!** :warning: 
- the creator of the PR should respond to all the questions and/or make changes requested (or say why don't want to change has to be a good reason)
- the final team member to review should `assign` the QA and add `awaiting-review` label :clock1: 
- the QA will review and reassign the creator of the PR and unassign themself :wave: 
- this step repeats until the PR can be merged :twisted_rightwards_arrows: and the branch deleted :x:
